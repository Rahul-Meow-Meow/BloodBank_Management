# CS-Project

Hey Rahul.. and team, I uh revamped quite a lot of things here.

Incase you wonder wth happened here, allow me to explain.
There are only six python files that we are using here.
- Blood_group_selector
- Donor_code
- Recipient_code
- Sql_functions
- Hospital_Login
- main code
I have commented all the edits required. 
Old_hospital_login and yea this is not needed lmao can be deleted but I kept it there just for the time being. You can take a call later.

Oh also, remember to change the password to root. Too much Dynamic Dharma.
