# CS-Project

YO Team, the project is basically over...all the major bugs are fixed
Now Bharat, you gotta do the final touches, make the outputs look more organised and beautiful(i wonder if u could pretty print that dictionary of donors so that it looks more organised)..and other team members please review the programs in your own desktop(remember, you dont need to create any tables beforehand, the program takes care of it for you just save all of them in the same folder on desktop)
